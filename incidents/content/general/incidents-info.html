	<strong>What Do We Consider Proof?</strong>
<li>
If there is no written proof, please ask the person you are getting the report from if there is anyone that can collaborate story.
</li>
<li>
What we consider proof is other people collaborating story (please take their statements in written form so we can post them here in the incident report). Game replays, chatlogs or any other kind of proof please provide them in the report.
</li>

<div class="margin-bottom-25">
	<strong>What we do not want in the incident reports</strong>
<li>
The incident reports should only contain proof or updates regarding the incident. They should not have any opinions on what should happen or shouldn't. We do not want to see any "votes" for bans etc. Just pure and simple proof unless stated otherwise.
</li>
<li>
The Owner or one of the Councils are the ones who will hand out any sort of warnings/punishment if necessary.
</li>
<li>
You shouldn't be handling any sort of punishment like kicking, banning or giving out warnings, you should only write objective report of the incident.
</li>

<li>
If you have any questions please feel free to PM me (NeSsQQuiCk) or Bathtub on the forums/discord and we will give you a reply ASAP.

	<strong>What Happens When There Is Already an Incident Report For the Person in Question?</strong>
<li>
If a member has an incident report against them from before and they get another one written against them, please do NOT make a new topic. Please update the already existing topic. This means that before you write an incident report please look through the already written ones to see if there is an incident report already written against him/her.
	If there is a topic already made. You use the template as usual and just make a REPLY with the new incident. This way it's less messy and we can keep track of people easier.
