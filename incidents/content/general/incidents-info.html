	<strong>When Do We Write Reports?</strong>
<li>
Incident reports should be written regarding any incident, big or small. The reason we write these incidents is because we want to keep track of people who are causing issues. Even if it's a small incident that may not require anything done against them we still want to keep them for future reference if the incident keeps occuring over and over. 
</li>
<li>
I cannot stress enough how important it is for these reports to be written.

	<strong>What Do We Consider Proof?</strong>
<li>
If there is no written proof, please ask the person you are getting the report from if there is anyone that can collaborate story.
</li>
<li>
What we consider proof is other people collaborating story (please take their statements in written form so we can post them here in the incident report). Game replays, chatlogs or any other kind of proof please provide them in the report.
</li>
</div>

<div class="margin-bottom-25">
	<strong>What we do not want in the incident reports</strong>
<li>
The incident reports should only contain proof or updates regarding the incident. They should not have any opinions on what should happen or shouldn't. We do not want to see any "votes" for bans etc. Just pure and simple proof unless stated otherwise.
</li>
<li>
The Senior moderators, Section Leaders, Officers, as well as Kezma and Eresea are the ones who will hand out any sort of warnings (unless asked otherwise).
</li>
<li>
The Section leaders and the Officers, as well as Kezma and Eresea are the only ones who will decide what punishment we will enforce. Both opinions of Section Leaders and Officers can at any time be overruled by Kezma or Eresea if we see fit.
</li>

<li>
If you have any questions please feel free to PM Eresea on the forums and she will give you a reply ASAP.

	<strong>What Happens When There Is Already an Icident Report For the Person in Question?</strong>
<li>
If a member has an incident report against them from before and they get another one written against them, please do NOT make a new topic. Please update the already existing topic. This means that before you write an incident report please look through the already written ones to see if there is an incident report already written against him/her. If there is a topic already made. You use the template as usual and just make a REPLY with the new incident. Also change the prefix to the correct one. You can check them here if you are unsure of which prefix to use. Please also change the title so it has the new date written as well. So for example Lets say I had an incident report written against me 2 days ago and a warning has been issued, then the new incident title today for the 2nd incident will look like the following:
</li>
<li>
Melidas - 25/2/2016 - 27/2/2016
<li>
</li>
With other words, please keep BOTH dates.
</li>
