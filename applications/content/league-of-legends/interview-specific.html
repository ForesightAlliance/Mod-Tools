			Make sure to determine what server they play on. The name of their server will be automatically added to the end of their TED title.
		</li>
		<li>
			Tell the trialist to follow the summoner's code, this means not flaming or AFKing.
		</li>
		<li>
			Also tell them to follow the League of Legends terms of use, this means not boosting, account sharing or hacking.
		</li>
		<li>
			Tell them there are 3 main ways to find a game with EG members:
		</li>
		<li>
			The first is to join the 'Looking for Game' near the top of the LoL section on TeamSpeak
		</li>
		<li>
			The second is for them to join the chat room in the LoL Client itself (pictured instructions + chatroom name in 
            <a href="http://forums.ethereal-gaming.com/showthread.php?189-In-Game-LoL-Chatroom-amp-Clubs-(Screenshots)" target="_blank">this thread</a>).
		</li>
		<li>
			The third is getting them to join the EG club, which a LoL mod will need to handle, as only they can send invites.
		</li>
		<li>
			Finally ask them to click the cog in the corner of the chat room and tick 'autojoin on startup.'
		</li>
		<li>
			Should put their forum name as their TS name.
		</li>
		<li>
			Link them to the inhouse schedule:

		</li>
		<li>
			Tell them about any events that will take place
