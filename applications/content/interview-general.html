	<strong>Guidelines</strong>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Comment on the application (inviting them to Discord) using "Applicant Comment" Box.
		</li>
		<li>
			Check "#assistance-notification" text channel to see when they joined the server and wait for them to join "Waiting Room" or PM them if you think they need some help.
		</li>
		<li>
			Move them from the Waiting Room to one of the Application Rooms.
		</li>
		<li>
			Do an initial greeting! Give a strong, friendly first impression, introduce yourself and thank them for their interest in Void Gaming.
		</li>
		<li>
			Find the application on the website. If there is not one, guide them through the application process, go through the things they need in the app: 16+, working microphone, and have read the Code of Conduct.
		</li>
		<li>
			Make sure the applicant meets all the requirements to join the community.
		</li>
		<li>
			Ask if they are familiar with Discord. If not, teach them the basics (enable mic, mute sound, voice settings, move voice channels, PM, text channels, account settings, desktop app etc.).
		</li>
		<li>
			Explain the basis of a trial. It's a 7 day period, where members will be able to upvote/downvote them in regards to friendliness, positivity, and activity. It'll be on a thread called a TFT(Trialist Feedback Thread) which will be private from other trialists and from himself.
			It's to prevent negative players from joining. They will get their application extended for 7 more days if they have a good reason for being inactive.
			Explain that voting is important and explain to them how to vote, so they know how to do it if they pass thier trial.
		</li>
		<li>
			Create a TFT. Use title and content of the thread from bottom of the tool. Approve the application! (don't forget to do this so they get forum permission)
		</li>

		<li>
			Head over to #trialist-information and use the command !trial add @discordname "tfturllinkyoujustmade" and give them Discord Trial permission (right click--> Roles--> Trial).
		</li>
		<li>
			Explain any other relevant information for the specific game like teams, events, coaching, chatrooms, inhouses etc. (if there is any it will be located in "Interview Game Speicifc" box)
		</li>

		<li>
			Remind and encourage the new Trialist to be active on both Discord and the Forums, as that is the activity we are looking for at the moment.
			Ask them if they have any questions, if yes, try your best to answer it, if not, welcome them to Void Gaming once again, wish them best of luck with their trial period, 
			tell them that they can always PM any staff member if they have any question in the future and leave the channel.
		</li>
