	<strong>Guidelines</strong>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Do an initial greeting! Give a strong, friendly first impression, introduce yourself and thank them for their interest in Void Gaming.
		</li>
		<li>
			Find the application. If there is not one, guide them through the application process. 
		</li>
		<li>
			Make sure the application has been accepted before you proceed. If not approved, go through the things they need in the app: 16+, working microphone, and have read the Code of Conduct.
		</li>
		<li>
			Ask if they are familiar with Discord. If not, teach them the basics (enable mic, mute sound, voice settings, move voice channels, PM, text channels, account settings, desktop app etc.).
		</li>
		<li>
			Explain the basis of a trial. It's a 7 day period, where members will be able to upvote/downvote them in regards to friendliness, positivity, and activity. It'll be on a thread called a TFT which will be private from other trialists and from himself. It's to prevent negative players from joining. They are not bound to their initial section.
		</li>
		<li>
			Create a TFT.

		</li>
		<li>
			Comment on the application using this tool.
		</li>
		<li>
			Post link of trialistâ€™s TFT in correct Discord text channel and give them Discord Trial permissions.
		</li>
		<li>
			Explain any other relevant information for the specific game (teams, events, coaching, chatrooms, etc.)
		</li>
		<li>
			Change the forum usergroup from Guest to Trialist.

		</li>
		<li>
			Remind and encourage the new Trialist to be active on both Discord and the Forums, as that is the activity we are looking for at the moment.
		</li>
