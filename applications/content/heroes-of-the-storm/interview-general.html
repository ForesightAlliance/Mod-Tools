	<strong>Guidelines</strong>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Do an initial greeting! Give a strong, friendly first impression, introduce yourself and thank them for their interest in Ethereal Gaming.
		</li>
		<li>
			Find the application. If there is not one, guide them through the application process. 
		</li>
		<li>
			Make sure the application has been accepted before you proceed. If not approved, go through the things they need in the app: 16+, working microphone, and have read the Code of Conduct.
		</li>
		<li>
			Ask if they are familiar with TS. If not, teach them the basics (enable mic, mute sound, set away, move channels, PM, and poke).
		</li>
		<li>
			Explain the basis of a trial. It's 2 a 2 week period, where members will be able to upvote/downvote them in regards to friendliness, positivity, and activity. It'll be on a thread called a TED which will be private from other trialists and from himself. It's to prevent negative players from joining. They are not bound to their initial section.
		</li>
		<li>
			Create a TED.
			(<a href="http://forums.ethereal-gaming.com/showthread.php?128-Applications-Teds-How-to-Templates" target="_blank">Link to Instructions</a>)
		</li>
		<li>
			Change the Application’s Prefix to Trial
			(<a href="http://forums.ethereal-gaming.com/showthread.php?128-Applications-Teds-How-to-Templates" target="_blank">Link to Instructions</a>)
		</li>
		<li>
			Comment on the application using the Application: On Trial line on the application tool.
		</li>
		<li>
			Add the link to the TED to the trialist’s description on Teamspeak (Right click on client - Change description) and give them Teamspeak Trial permissions.
		</li>
		<li>
			Explain any other relevant information for the specific game (teams, events, chatrooms, etc.)
		</li>
		<li>
			Change the forum usergroup from Guest to Trialist. (ou can find instructions 
			<a href="http://forums.ethereal-gaming.com/showthread.php?128-Applications-Teds-How-to-Templates" target="_blank">here</a>, but the basis is go to their forum profile, click the little pencil above their name, log in, change the primary usergroup to "Trial".)
		</li>
		<li>
			Remind and encourage the new Trialist to be active on both TS and the Forums, as that is the activity we are looking for at the moment.
		</li>
		<li>
			Speak about how we handle incidents. Link them the <a href="http://forums.ethereal-gaming.com/showthread.php?831" target="_blank">Who do I contact?</a> thread. Tell them to reach a moderator if anything negative happens, no matter how petty. If they find it offensive, let them know staff is here to help.
		</li>
