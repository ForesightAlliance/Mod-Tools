		<li>
			Do an initial greeting! Give a strong, friendly first impression, introduce yourself and thank them for their interest in Ethereal Gaming.
		</li>

		</li>
		<li>
			Make sure the application has been accepted before you proceed.
		</li>
		<li>
			Create a TED.

		</li>
		<li>
			Change the Application’s Prefix to Trial

		</li>
		<li>
			Comment on the application using the Application: On Trial line on the application tool.

		<li>
			Add the link to the TED to the trialist’s description on Teamspeak (Right click on client - Change description) and give them Teamspeak Trial permissions.
		</li>
		<li>
			Explain the basis of a trial (How a TED works, what it is, forum/ts/game activity, etc)
		</li>
		<li>
			Explain any other relevant information for the specific game (teams, events, chatrooms, etc.)
		</li>
		<li>
			Change the forum usergroup from Guest to Trialist. (ou can find instructions 
			<a href="http://forums.ethereal-gaming.com/showthread.php?128-Applications-Teds-How-to-Templates" target="_blank">here</a>, but the basis is go to their forum profile, click the little pencil above their name, log in, change the primary usergroup to "Trial".)
		</li>
		<li>
			Remind and encourage the new Trialist to be active on both TS and the Forums, as that is the activity we are looking for at the moment.
		</li>
