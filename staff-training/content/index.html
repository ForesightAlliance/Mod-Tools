<li>
Explain applications first, start with explaining which apps do we reject and which do we approve (underaged, wrong region, no microphone).
</li> <br> 
<li>
Explain how our #assistance-notification channel works and direct them to the application mod tool. Explain how to use the tool,
 and tell them to take a minute to read the guideliness to see if they understand how to do the interview, make sure they understand it!
 Help them understand what they have to do (create tft, give permissions on discord, give permissions on website) and try to either listen
  to their first interview or pretend like you are trialist and let them try. :)
